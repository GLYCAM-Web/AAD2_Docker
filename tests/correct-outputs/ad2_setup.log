Starting the AD2 setup log at: Fri Feb 21 05:06:52 UTC 2025
Setting the working directory to: /programs/code-temp
Found existing vcconfig. Not clobbering it.
Setup finished.

If there are files ending in .example in this directory, you need to fill the proper values 
into them and remove any values that are not relevant to you. Then, remove '.example' from 
the filenames. Don't forget to add all the needed files to the working directory.


When fully set up, the working directory should contain these things:

    - The antibody PDB file 

    - The glycan PDB file

    - The glycan ring atoms file called 'glycan_ring_atoms.txt'

    - An AD2 configuration file

    - A VC configuration file

    - If Use_Docker is set to True, there should also be a docker config file
