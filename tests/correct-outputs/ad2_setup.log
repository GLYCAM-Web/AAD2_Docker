Starting the AD2 setup log at: Mon Mar  3 12:02:14 UTC 2025
Setting the working directory to: /home/antibodydocking/workdir/AAD2_Docker/tests/outputs
Found existing vcconfig. Not clobbering it.
If you have set random number seeds, they will be put in place later in the process unless you
have already made the subdirectories and placed vcconfig files there. In that case, these scripts will
not overwrite them.

Setup finished.

If there are files ending in .example in this directory, you need to fill the proper values 
into them and remove any values that are not relevant to you. Then, remove '.example' from 
the filenames. Don't forget to add all the needed files to the working directory.


When fully set up, the working directory should contain these things:

    - The antibody PDB file 

    - The glycan PDB file

    - The glycan ring atoms file called 'glycan_ring_atoms.txt'

    - An AD2 configuration file

    - A VC configuration file

    - If Use_Docker is set to True, there should also be a docker config file
